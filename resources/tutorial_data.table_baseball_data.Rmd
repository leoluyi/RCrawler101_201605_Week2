```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# set global chunk options
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(cache=FALSE)
```

## Baseball data

First of all, load required packages.

```{r loadPackages}
## load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(Lahman)  # for baseball data
```

## Merge data




```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
